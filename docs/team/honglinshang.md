## Overview
Apollo is a Java-based scheduling app for managing your tasks, events, deadlines and modules optimized for use via
a Command Line Interface (CLI). Its target users are NUS students. It is set apart from existing schedulers as it 
integrates NUS module information from the NUSMods database.
